      <pre class="ROMEO">ROMEO
         I take thee at thy word:
         Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
         Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
      </pre>
      <pre class="JULIET">JULIET
         What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
         So stumblest on my counsel?
       </pre>
       <pre class="ROMEO">ROMEO
         By a name<br />
         I know not how to tell thee who I am:
         My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
         Because it is an enemy to thee;
         Had I it written, I would tear the word.
       </pre>
       <pre class="JULIET">JULIET
         My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
         Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
         Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
       </pre>
       <pre class="ROMEO">ROMEO
         Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
       </pre>
       <pre class="JULIET">JULIET
         How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
         The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
         And the place death, considering who thou art,
         If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
       </pre>
       <pre class="ROMEO">ROMEO
         With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
         For stony limits cannot hold love out,
         And what love can do that dares love attempt;
         Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
       </pre>
       <pre class="JULIET">JULIET
         If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
       </pre>
       <pre class="ROMEO">ROMEO
         Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
         Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
         And I am proof against their enmity.
       </pre>
       <pre class="JULIET">JULIET
         I would not for the world they saw thee here.
       </pre>
